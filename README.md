# ECHO_AI
#### Video Demo : https://youtu.be/koiPMhMjgo8
#### Description
Echo AI is a personal intelligent assistant that is designed to understand and respond to voice commands. It is built using Python and several third-party libraries such as pyttsx3, speech_recognition, wikipedia, pywhatkit, pyfiglet, and speedtest. With Echo AI, you can perform various tasks such as searching on the web, getting information from Wikipedia, opening applications, chatting with OpenAI, and checking internet speed.

There are some Requirements before running the program mentioned in the Requirements.txt file in the Repository.I kindly request to Fulfill the requirements to run the Program.

This Python Program is just a basic use of Different Python Libraries/Modules/Packages and it taught me how to get around with reading the documentation and implement several libraries and functions.

Considering its just a simple chatbot , It couldnt be considered an AI but if we look at the simple definiton of an AI , it states that anything that can automate a Humans Work and do it efficiently can be considered an AI. This was just Scratching the surface of what can be done with the Python Libraries in the world of AI and theres a vast ocean of them. I will be making a Public Repository on My Account on Github with the Username : MeetD99 , If you liked this Idea we can Collaborate and build complex Programs .

#### Installation

To run Echo AI, you need to have Python installed on your computer. You also need to install the following libraries:
<ul>
<li>pyttsx3</li>
<li>speech_recognition</li>
<li>wikipedia</li>
<li>webbrowser</li>
<li>os</li>
<li>pywhatkit</li>
<li>pyfiglet</li>
<li>creds (contains OpenAI API key)</li>
<li>openai</hi>
<li>speedtest</li>
</ul>

->You can install these libraries using pip. For example:

pip install pyttsx3\

After installing the libraries, you can run the program using the following command:

python chatbot.py

#### How to Use

When you run the program, Echo AI will greet you and ask how it can help you. You can then give it voice commands to perform various tasks. Here are some examples:

• "Wikipedia Python": This command will search for the Python article on Wikipedia and read the first two sentences.\
• "Open Google": This command will open Google in your default web browser.\
• "What's the time?": This command will tell you the current time.\
• "Play Despacito on YouTube": This command will search for the Despacito video on YouTube and play it.\
• "Chat GPT": This command will start a conversation with OpenAI's GPT-3 and provide a response to the given prompt.\
• "Internet Speed": This command will test your internet download and upload speed and report the results.\
• "Exit": This command will exit the program.
